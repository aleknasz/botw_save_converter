# botw_save_converter
Converts Zelda BOTW save files from Switch to Wii U and vice versa

Should be usable on all operating systems - Windows, Linux and Mac.

Once you install .NET SDK 6.0 on your platform, run following command from your cloned project folder: dotnet build -c Release

The binaries should be in folder like: ./botw_save_converter/bin/Release/net6.0

If you still have any problems with building, I can only suggest you to download some IDE, open that project and run it (so IDE will guess that it should first compile that project for you).

Some day I might rewrite this converter to Golang (as an opportunity to learn more Golang), so it would be a bit easier to build and run.
