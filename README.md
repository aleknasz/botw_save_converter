# botw_save_converter
Converts Zelda BOTW save files from Switch to Wii U and vice versa

Should be usable on all operating systems - Windows, Linux and Mac.
I have no detailed building instructions, since Microsoft is known from providing a crap.
I can only suggest to download some IDE, open that project and run it (so IDE will guess that it should first compile that project for you).
Some day I might rewrite that to Golang, then it will be a bit easier to build (still not perfect as you will have to pray a bit for success - don't know why people have tendency to write hard to use software).
